## üìä Data Management

### Database Location

- **Files**: Stored in app's internal storage
- **Photos**: Copied to app's internal photos directory

### Data Persistence
- All data persists between app sessions
- Sample data is automatically loaded if no Excel file is uploaded
- Excel data replaces sample data when uploaded

### Excel File Synchronization
The app now automatically updates your Excel file when changes are made:

#### What Gets Updated:
1. **Product Amounts**: When you confirm a sale, the product quantities are automatically reduced in your Excel file
2. **Product Notes**: When you edit notes in admin mode, changes are saved back to the Excel file
3. **Expiry Dates**: Any changes to expiry dates are reflected in the Excel file

#### How It Works:
1. **Upload Excel**: First, upload your Excel file through the Settings screen
2. **Make Changes**: Use the app normally - make sales, edit notes, etc.
3. **Automatic Sync**: The app automatically updates your Excel file in the background
4. **File Location**: Updated Excel file is stored in the app's internal storage

#### Important Notes:
- The Excel file must be uploaded through the app's Settings screen for synchronization to work
- Only the uploaded Excel file is updated - other Excel files on your device remain unchanged
- The app maintains the original Excel structure and formatting
- All updates are performed safely with error handling

### Backup and Restore
- Currently, data is stored locally only
